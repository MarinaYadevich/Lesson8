Task1.
Create a Build class with one type field. Create 2 descendants of this class - House and
Garage, in which, when created in the constructor, the values
“House” and “Garage” will be assigned to the type field, respectively. In the main method of another class, create objects of the House
and Garage classes. Demonstrate the values ​​of the fields of these classes using getters.

HomeWork.Task1.
Create a program to simulate the work of a clinic. Let there be three doctors in the clinic: a surgeon, a therapist, and a dentist. 
Each doctor has a "treat" method, but each doctor treats in his or her own way.
Also provide a "Patient" class with a "Treatment Plan" field and a "Doctor" field. Create an object of the "Patient" class and add a treatment plan to the patient. 
Create a method for the therapist that will assign a doctor to the patient according to the treatment plan:
If the treatment plan has code 1, assign a surgeon and perform the treat method.
If the treatment plan has code 2, assign a dentist and perform the treat method.
If the treatment plan has any other code, assign a therapist and perform the treat method.
